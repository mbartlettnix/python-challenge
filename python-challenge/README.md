Python Homework

PyBank 
In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. You will be given two sets of revenue data (budget_data_1.csv and budget_data_2.csv). Each dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Revenue. 

Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:


The total number of months included in the dataset
The total amount of revenue gained over the entire period
The average change in revenue between months over the entire period
The greatest increase in revenue (date and amount) over the entire period
The greatest decrease in revenue (date and amount) over the entire period

Your final script must be able to handle any such similarly structured dataset in the future  In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

PyBoss 
Your task is to help bridge the gap by creating a Python script able to convert your employee records to the required format. Your script will need to do the following: 
The Name column should be split into separate First Name and Last Name columns.
The DOB data should be re-written into DD/MM/YYYY format.
The SSN data should be re-written such that the first five numbers are hidden from view.
The State data should be re-written as simple two-letter abbreviations.
